# Deploying Your Own Instance

A complete walkthrough for standing up your own copy of WME Requests on Cloudflare — dashboard, API, database, and userscript all pointed at your own deployment.

---

## 1 — Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) account (the free tier is enough)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and npm
- The Wrangler CLI:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

## 2 — Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelrosstarr/wme-requests.git
cd wme-requests
npm install
```

## 3 — Create the D1 database

```bash
npm run db:create
```

This prints a `database_id`. Copy it into `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "DB",
    "database_name": "wme-requests",
    "database_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", // <- paste here
    "remote": true
  }
]
```

## 4 — Apply the schema

All migrations need to run, in order, against **both** your local dev database and the remote (production) one:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

This applies everything under [`migrations/`](migrations/):

| Migration | Adds |
|---|---|
| `0001_initial.sql` | Core schema — `countries`, `notification_channels`, `requests` |
| `0002_better_auth.sql` | Auth tables (sessions, accounts) for the dashboard login |
| `0003_editor_rank.sql` | `requests.editor_rank` — the submitter's WME editor rank |
| `0004_channel_custom_prefix.sql` | `notification_channels.custom_prefix` — the templated prefix feature |
| `0005_channel_email.sql` | `email`/`webhook` notification platforms + `notification_channels.email_to` |
| `0006_user_country_access.sql` | `user.is_global` + `user_countries` — per-user country scoping |
| `0007_discord_forum_thread.sql` | `notification_channels.discord_forum` |
| `0008_google_sheets_channel.sql` | `google_sheets` platform + `spreadsheet_id`/`sheet_name` |
| `0009_request_screenshot.sql` | `requests.screenshot_key` |
| `0010_channel_google_credentials.sql` | (superseded by `0012`/`0013` below) |
| `0011_regions.sql` | `regions` — country-scoped states/provinces |
| `0012_credentials.sql` | `credentials` — the shared Google service-account pool + per-user BYOK email credentials |
| `0013_channel_credential_refs.sql` | `notification_channels.google_credential_id`/`email_credential_id`, replacing the old per-channel embedded credential |
| `0014_google_chat_channel.sql` | `google_chat` notification platform |
| `0015_push_subscriptions.sql` | `push_subscriptions` — self-service browser Web Push, independent of the channels above |
| `0016_ntfy_gotify_channels.sql` | `ntfy` and `gotify` notification platforms |
| `0022_passkey.sql` | `passkey` — WebAuthn credentials for **Sign in with passkey** (managed from the Account page) |
| `0023_two_factor.sql` | `user.twoFactorEnabled`, `twoFactor` and `securityKey` — two-factor authentication (email codes, authenticator app, security keys, backup codes) |
| `0024_security_events.sql` | `security_events` — per-user security log (sign-ins, failed sign-ins, sign-in method and 2FA changes) shown on the Account page |
| `0025_central_auth.sql` | `user_access` (who may use this app, `is_global`, `feed_token`), copied from `user` — sign-in moved to the WMEKit account service, and Better Auth's tables (0002, 0022–0024) are no longer used |

You'll re-run `db:migrate:remote` any time you pull a future update that adds a new migration file — `wrangler d1 migrations apply` only applies migrations that haven't run yet, so it's always safe to re-run.

## 5 — Configure CORS (optional)

`wrangler.jsonc`'s `vars.ALLOWED_ORIGINS` restricts which cross-origin callers can hit the public `POST /api/requests` endpoint (the one the userscript calls from waze.com). It defaults to Waze's own domains:

```jsonc
"vars": {
  "ALLOWED_ORIGINS": "https://waze.com,https://www.waze.com,https://beta.waze.com"
}
```

Leave this as-is unless you're doing something unusual — it doesn't need to include your own dashboard's domain (same-origin requests aren't subject to CORS in the first place).

## 6 — Sign-in: the WMEKit account service

Accounts live in the WMEKit account service ([wmeAuth](../wmeAuth), https://auth.wmekit.com),
shared with WME Sync: password, passkeys, Discord, two-factor, Turnstile, auth emails and the
security log are all there. Deploy it first (its DEPLOYMENT.md). This app only decides who gets
in (`user_access`) and which countries they see (`user_countries`).

This Worker reaches the account service over a **service binding** named `AUTH` (`services` in
`wrangler.jsonc`, bound to the Worker `wmeauth`): sessions are checked with
`AUTH.fetch(".../api/auth/get-session")`, and adding users / sending reset links are RPC calls.
Worker-to-worker, so there's no shared secret.

1. In `wrangler.jsonc`, `vars.APP_URL` is this app's origin and `vars.AUTH_URL` the account
   service's. For local dev, add `APP_URL=http://localhost:3000` and
   `AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001` to `.dev.vars`.
2. This app's origin must be in wmeAuth's `APP_ORIGINS`, or it won't redirect back here after
   sign-in.
3. Both must be on the same parent domain: the session cookie is set for `.wmekit.com`.

### Moving an existing deployment over

Existing users keep their accounts: wmeAuth's `scripts/import-users.mjs` copies this database's
users (same ids, password hashes, Discord links and re-encrypted 2FA) into the account service,
and migration `0025` gives each of them exactly the access they had. Passkeys and security keys
can't move (they're bound to this hostname), so those users see a one-time "add your passkey
again" banner on their WMEKit account page. The order matters — see wmeAuth's DEPLOYMENT.md.

## 7 — (removed) Email Sending

Auth emails (invites, password resets, 2FA codes, security alerts) are sent by the account
service now, so this app has no `EMAIL` binding. Notification-channel emails still go through
the BYOK credentials from step 9.

## 8 — (removed) Discord sign-in

"Sign in with Discord" is configured on the account service. (Discord *notification channels*
are unaffected — they use webhooks.)

## 9 — Configure the Credentials Manager (optional)

**Admin → Credentials** holds two kinds of reusable, encrypted-at-rest credential that
notification channels reference instead of embedding a secret directly:

- **Google Service Accounts** — a shared pool. Add one and reuse it across as many
  `google_sheets` channels as you like; only global users can add or remove them.
- **Email Credentials** — BYOK. Each user adds their own Postmark, Mailgun, or SMTP
  credential, and picks it when configuring an `email` notification channel. A non-global user
  only sees their own; global users see everyone's.

Skip this step if you're not using the `google_sheets` or `email` notification platforms.

1. Set `CHANNEL_CREDENTIALS_KEY`, a random 256-bit key used to encrypt every credential in D1:

   ```bash
   # Local development — appended to .dev.vars (already gitignored)
   echo "CHANNEL_CREDENTIALS_KEY=$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))")" >> .dev.vars

   # Production — stored as an encrypted Worker secret, not a plain var
   wrangler secret put CHANNEL_CREDENTIALS_KEY
   ```

   Regenerate the Worker's env types after adding it:

   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

2. **For Google Sheets:** in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/),
   create a service account and download its JSON key file, with the **Google Sheets API**
   enabled for that project. Share the target spreadsheet with the service account's
   `client_email` (Editor access) — otherwise appends will fail with a permission error. In
   **Admin → Credentials**, add a **Google Service Account** credential and paste the full
   contents of the downloaded JSON key file — it's encrypted before being stored and isn't
   shown again after saving. Then, when adding/editing a `google_sheets` channel, pick it from
   the **Google Service Account** dropdown (and paste the spreadsheet ID from the sheet's URL,
   the segment between `/d/` and `/edit`).
3. **For email:** in **Admin → Credentials**, add an **Email Credential** with whichever
   provider you use — a Postmark server token, a Mailgun API key + sending domain, or SMTP
   host/port/username/password. Then, when adding/editing an `email` channel, pick it from the
   **Email Credential** dropdown. SMTP sends over a raw TCP connection (via
   [`worker-mailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/worker-mailer)) on port 587 or 465 — port 25
   isn't reachable from Workers.

## 10 — Configure Web Push notifications (optional)

Unlike the channels above, Web Push isn't admin-configured — any signed-in user can click
**Notify me** on the dashboard to subscribe their own browser to a country (optionally scoped to
a region and request type). Skip this step if you don't need browser push notifications.

1. Generate a VAPID key pair with the bundled CLI from
   [`@pushforge/builder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushforge/builder) (already a project
   dependency — no separate install needed):

   ```bash
   npx @pushforge/builder vapid
   ```

   This prints a public key and a private key in JWK format.

2. Set the private key as a secret (never in `wrangler.jsonc`):

   ```bash
   # Local development — appended to .dev.vars (already gitignored) as the raw JSON string
   echo 'WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_JWK={"alg":"ES256",...}' >> .dev.vars

   # Production
   wrangler secret put WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PRIVATE_JWK
   ```

3. Set the public key and a contact address as plain vars in `wrangler.jsonc` (the public key is
   safe to expose — it's sent to the browser as `applicationServerKey`):

   ```jsonc
   "vars": {
     "WEB_PUSH_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY": "your-public-key-here",
     "WEB_PUSH_CONTACT": "mailto:you@example.com"
   }
   ```

4. Regenerate the Worker's env types and re-migrate for `push_subscriptions`:

   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   npm run db:migrate:local
   npm run db:migrate:remote
   ```

## 11 — (removed) Cloudflare Turnstile

The sign-in forms, and their Turnstile widget, are on the account service.

## 12 — Give the first admin access

Sign up (or sign in) on the account service and open this app once — you'll see "Ask an admin
for access", which also creates your local user row. Then grant yourself global access:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute wme-requests --remote --command "INSERT INTO user_access (user_id, is_global) SELECT id, 1 FROM \"user\" WHERE email = 'you@example.com'"
```

Everyone after that is managed from **/admin → Users** by a global user: **Add user** finds the
WMEKit account by email (or has the account service create one and email a link to set a
password), **Edit Access** changes their countries, **Reset Password** emails them a reset
link, and **Remove** takes away their access (their WMEKit account stays).

## 13 — Try it locally

```bash
(cd ../wmeAuth && npm run dev)   # the account service, on :3001
npm run dev
```

**Careful:** the D1 binding has `"remote": true`, so `npm run dev` reads and writes the
**production** database. To try changes against a local database instead, build and run the
Worker with a copy of `dist/server/wrangler.json` that drops `"remote": true`:
`npx wrangler dev -c <that copy> --persist-to .wrangler/state`.

Open `http://localhost:3000` — `/requests`, `/admin` and `/reports` hand off to the account
service's sign-in page on :3001 (cookies ignore the port, so the session comes back). Sign in
with the account from step 12, then set
up at least one country and notification channel from the `/admin` page before moving on (see
[README § Notification Channels](README.md#notification-channels) for the channel body fields
and `custom_prefix` variables).

## 14 — Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds and pushes the Worker to Cloudflare. Your app is now live at `https://<project>.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev` (or a custom domain if you've attached one in the Cloudflare dashboard).

Production is `requests.wmekit.com`. Keep `requests.wazetools.com` (the pre-move host) attached as
well: `src/server-entry.ts` 301s its pages to `APP_URL` but keeps serving `/api/*` there for copies
of the userscript that haven't updated yet.

If this is your very first deploy and you haven't run step 4's `db:migrate:remote` yet, do that now — the deployed Worker needs the schema in place before it can serve any API requests.

## 15 — Point the userscript at your deployment

Open [`userscript/wme-requests.user.js`](userscript/wme-requests.user.js) — the built script Tampermonkey actually installs — and update:

```js
const DEFAULT_API_BASE = 'https://YOUR-PROJECT.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev';
```

Then install the script in Tampermonkey (or Greasemonkey). If you'd rather not edit the file, you can also leave the default as a placeholder and set the real URL later from inside WME: open the **WME Requests** panel → **Settings** → paste your Workers URL into **API Base URL** → **Save**. That value is stored per-browser via `GM_setValue`, so it persists across script updates without touching the file.

The script's source is TypeScript, at [`userscript/src/main.user.ts`](userscript/src/main.user.ts) — see [`userscript/README.md`](userscript/README.md) for the build. If you've set that up and plan to keep rebuilding, edit `DEFAULT_API_BASE` there instead: `npm run build` regenerates `userscript/wme-requests.user.js` and would overwrite an edit made directly in the built file.

## 16 — Updating later

```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run db:migrate:local   # picks up any new migration files
npm run db:migrate:remote  # same, against production
npm run deploy
```

Since `wrangler d1 migrations apply` only runs migrations it hasn't seen before, this sequence is safe to repeat every time you pull updates, even if nothing changed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Userscript panel never appears / actions silently do nothing**: open the browser console and look for lines prefixed `[WME Requests]` — the script logs diagnostic info whenever it can't find something it expects from WME's own SDK (selection getter, country lookup, user info, etc.), rather than failing silently.
- **Signed in, but every page says "Ask an admin for access"**: that WMEKit account has no
  `user_access` row. A global user adds it from **Admin → Users → Add user** (by email).
- **Signing in loops back to the account service, or the API answers 401**: the session check
  over the `AUTH` binding failed. Look for "get-session over AUTH binding failed" in the Worker
  logs, check the `wmeauth` Worker is deployed, and that this app is on a `*.wmekit.com`
  origin (the cookie isn't sent anywhere else).
- **"Internal server error" on submit**: almost always a pending D1 migration — re-run `npm run db:migrate:remote`.
- **CORS errors in the browser console** (only relevant if you're calling the public endpoint from somewhere other than the userscript): check `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `wrangler.jsonc` includes the exact origin making the request, then redeploy — this var only takes effect on the next `wrangler deploy`.
